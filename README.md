The purpose of this project is to query the API of DolEX Financial Services to extract a list of branches. More specifically, a list of branches located within the state of California. 
The specific API endpoint that will be used is the "Branches" endpoint. This endpoint will return a list of branches that are located within the state of California.
The data that will be extracted from the API will be stored in a pandas dataframe. The dataframe will contain the following columns:
 - Branch Name
 - Branch Address
 - Branch City
 - Branch State
 - Branch Zip Code
